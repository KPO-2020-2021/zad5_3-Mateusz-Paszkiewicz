{\bfseries{doctest}} has been designed from the start to be as {\bfseries{light}} and {\bfseries{unintrusive}} as possible. These key features should be kept.\hypertarget{md_external_doctest_doc_markdown_features_autotoc_md109}{}\doxysection{Unintrusive (transparent)\+:}\label{md_external_doctest_doc_markdown_features_autotoc_md109}

\item everything is in the {\ttfamily doctest} namespace (and the implementation details are in a nested {\ttfamily detail} namespace)
