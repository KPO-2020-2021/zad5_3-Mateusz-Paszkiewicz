{\bfseries{doctest}} needs to be able to convert types you use in assertions and logging expressions into strings (for logging and reporting purposes). Most built-\/in types are supported out of the box but there are three ways that you can tell {\bfseries{doctest}} how to convert your own types (or other, third-\/party types) into strings.

For stringifying enums checkout \href{https://github.com/onqtam/doctest/issues/121}{\texttt{ this issue}}.\hypertarget{md_external_doctest_doc_markdown_stringification_autotoc_md138}{}\doxysection{$<$tt$>$operator$<$$<$$<$/tt$>$ overload for $<$tt$>$std\+::ostream$<$/tt$>$}\label{md_external_doctest_doc_markdown_stringification_autotoc_md138}
This is the standard way of providing string conversions in C++ -\/ and the chances are you may already provide this for your own purposes. If you\textquotesingle{}re not familiar with this idiom it involves writing a free function of the form\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{ \{c++\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{std::ostream\& operator<< (std::ostream\& os, const T\& value) \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    os << convertMyTypeToString(value);}
\DoxyCodeLine{    return os;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}
\end{DoxyCode}


(where {\ttfamily T} is your type and {\ttfamily convert\+My\+Type\+To\+String} is where you\textquotesingle{}ll write whatever code is necessary to make your type printable -\/ it doesn\textquotesingle{}t have to be in another function).

You should put this function in the same namespace as your type.

Alternatively you may prefer to write it as a member function\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{ \{c++\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{std::ostream\& T::operator<<(std::ostream\& os) const \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    os << convertMyTypeToString(*this);}
\DoxyCodeLine{    return os;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}
\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md_external_doctest_doc_markdown_stringification_autotoc_md139}{}\doxysection{$<$tt$>$doctest\+::to\+String$<$/tt$>$ overload}\label{md_external_doctest_doc_markdown_stringification_autotoc_md139}
If you don\textquotesingle{}t want to provide an {\ttfamily operator$<$$<$} overload, or you want to convert your type differently for testing purposes, you can provide an overload for {\ttfamily to\+String()} for your type which returns {\ttfamily doctest\+::\+String}.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{ \{c++\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{namespace user \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    struct udt \{\};}
\DoxyCodeLine{    }
\DoxyCodeLine{    doctest::String toString(const udt\& value) \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{        return convertMyTypeToString(value);}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}
\end{DoxyCode}


Note that the function must be in the same namespace as your type. If the type is not in any namespace -\/ then the overload should be in the global namespace as well. {\ttfamily convert\+My\+Type\+To\+String} is where you\textquotesingle{}ll write whatever code is necessary to make your type printable.\hypertarget{md_external_doctest_doc_markdown_stringification_autotoc_md140}{}\doxysection{$<$tt$>$doctest\+::\+String\+Maker$<$\+T$>$$<$/tt$>$ specialisation}\label{md_external_doctest_doc_markdown_stringification_autotoc_md140}
There are some cases where overloading {\ttfamily to\+String} does not work as expected. Specialising {\ttfamily String\+Maker$<$T$>$} gives you more precise and reliable control -\/ but at the cost of slightly more code and complexity\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{ \{c++\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{namespace doctest \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    template<> struct StringMaker<T> \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{        static String convert(const T\& value) \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{            return convertMyTypeToString(value);}
\DoxyCodeLine{        \}}
\DoxyCodeLine{    \};}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}
\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md_external_doctest_doc_markdown_stringification_autotoc_md141}{}\doxysection{Translating exceptions}\label{md_external_doctest_doc_markdown_stringification_autotoc_md141}
By default all exceptions deriving from {\ttfamily std\+::exception} will be translated to strings by calling the {\ttfamily what()} method (also C strings). For exception types that do not derive from {\ttfamily std\+::exception} -\/ or if {\ttfamily what()} does not return a suitable string -\/ use {\ttfamily R\+E\+G\+I\+S\+T\+E\+R\+\_\+\+E\+X\+C\+E\+P\+T\+I\+O\+N\+\_\+\+T\+R\+A\+N\+S\+L\+A\+T\+OR}. This defines a function that takes your exception type and returns a {\ttfamily doctest\+::\+String}. It can appear anywhere in the code -\/ it doesn\textquotesingle{}t have to be in the same translation unit. For example\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{ \{c++\}}
\DoxyCodeLine{REGISTER\_EXCEPTION\_TRANSLATOR(MyType\& ex) \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{    return doctest::String(ex.message());}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}
\end{DoxyCode}


Note that the exception may be accepted without a reference but it is considered bad practice in C++.

An alternative way to register an exception translator is to do the following in some function -\/ before executing any tests\+:

\`{}\`{}{\ttfamily c++ // adding a lambda -\/ the signature required is}doctest\+::\+String(exception\+\_\+type)\`{} doctest\+::register\+Exception\+Translator$<$int$>$(\mbox{[}\mbox{]}(int in)\{ return doctest\+::to\+String(in); \}); \`{}\`{}\`{}

The order of registering exception translators can be controlled -\/ simply call the explicit function in the required order or list the exception translators with the macro in a top-\/to-\/bottom fashion in a single translation unit -\/ everything that auto-\/registers in doctest works in a top-\/to-\/bottom way for a single translation unit (source file).

\item Check out the \href{../../examples/all_features/stringification.cpp}{\texttt{ {\bfseries{example}}}} which shows how to stringify {\ttfamily std\+::vector$<$T$>$} and other types/exceptions.
\item Note that the type {\ttfamily String} is used when specializing {\ttfamily String\+Maker$<$T$>$} or overloading {\ttfamily to\+String()} -\/ it is the string type {\bfseries{doctest}} works with. {\ttfamily std\+::string} is not an option because doctest would have to include the {\ttfamily $<$string$>$} header.
\item To support the {\ttfamily operator$<$$<$(std\+::ostream\&...} stringification the library has to offer a forward declaration of {\ttfamily std\+::ostream} and that is what the library does -\/ but it is forbidden by the standard. It currently works everywhere -\/ on all tested compilers -\/ but if the user wishes to be 100\% standards compliant -\/ then the \href{configuration.md\#doctest_config_use_std_headers}{\texttt{ $\ast$$\ast${\ttfamily D\+O\+C\+T\+E\+S\+T\+\_\+\+C\+O\+N\+F\+I\+G\+\_\+\+U\+S\+E\+\_\+\+S\+T\+D\+\_\+\+H\+E\+A\+D\+E\+RS}$\ast$$\ast$}} identifier can be used to force the inclusion of {\ttfamily $<$iosfwd$>$}. The reason the header is not included by default is that on M\+S\+VC (for example) it drags a whole bunch of stuff with it -\/ and after the preprocessor is finished the translation unit has grown to 42k lines of C++ code -\/ while Clang and the libc++ are so well implemented that including {\ttfamily $<$iosfwd$>$} there results in 400 lines of code.
