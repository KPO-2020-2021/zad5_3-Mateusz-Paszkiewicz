This library is free, and will stay free but needs your support to sustain its development. There are lots of $\ast$$\ast$new features$\ast$$\ast$ and maintenance to do. If you work for a company using {\bfseries{doctest}} or have the means to do so, please consider financial support.

Consider opening an issue for a discussion before making a pull request to make sure the contribution goes smoothly.

All pull requests should be made against the {\ttfamily dev} branch because the {\ttfamily master} is the stable one with the latest release.

If you\textquotesingle{}re going to change something in the library itself -\/ make sure you don\textquotesingle{}t modify {\ttfamily doctest/doctest.\+h} because it\textquotesingle{}s generated from {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{doctest__fwd_8h_source}{doctest/parts/doctest\+\_\+fwd.\+h}}} and {\ttfamily doctest/parts/doctest.\+cpp} -\/ they get concatenated by C\+Make -\/ so make sure you do a C\+Make build after you modify them so the {\ttfamily assemble\+\_\+single\+\_\+header} target gets built. Also take into consideration how the change affects the code coverage -\/ based on the project in {\ttfamily examples/all\+\_\+features}. Also update any relevant examples in the {\ttfamily examples} folder.

This framework has some design goals which must be kept. Make sure you have read the $\ast$$\ast$features and design goals$\ast$$\ast$ page.

If your changes also change the output of the library -\/ you should also update the reference output for the tests or otherwise the CI builds ({\ttfamily travis} and {\ttfamily appveyor}) will fail when they compare the latest output to the outdated reference output (which is committed in the repository). To do this run C\+Make with the {\ttfamily D\+O\+C\+T\+E\+S\+T\+\_\+\+T\+E\+S\+T\+\_\+\+M\+O\+DE} variable set to {\ttfamily C\+O\+L\+L\+E\+CT} (making the new reference output) and then run {\ttfamily ctest} and commit the changed (or newly created) {\ttfamily .txt} files in the {\ttfamily test\+\_\+output} folders too. The default {\ttfamily D\+O\+C\+T\+E\+S\+T\+\_\+\+T\+E\+S\+T\+\_\+\+M\+O\+DE} is {\ttfamily C\+O\+M\+P\+A\+RE}.

Example\+: {\ttfamily cmake -\/D\+D\+O\+C\+T\+E\+S\+T\+\_\+\+T\+E\+S\+T\+\_\+\+M\+O\+DE=C\+O\+L\+L\+E\+CT path/to/sources \&\& cmake -\/-\/build . \&\& ctest}

Code should be formatted with a recent-\/enough {\ttfamily clang-\/format} using the config file in the root of the repo (or I will do it...)

Testing with compilers different from G\+C\+C/\+Clang/\+M\+S\+VC (and more platforms) is something the project would benefit from.
